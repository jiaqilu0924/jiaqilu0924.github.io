Hello! I am Jiaqi Lu, a Ph.D. student at Harvard University, advised by Professor [Xiaowei Zhuang](https://zhuang.harvard.edu/index.html). My Ph.D. thesis focuses on imaging-based functional genomics, developing high throughput single-cell perturbation experimental platforms and AI models to study the functions of hundreds and thousands of genes and proteins. I have been applying the platform and models I developed to the study of [undisclosed topic 1] and [undisclosed topic 2], two ancient and mysterious biology that nature has evolved. My computational work with Professors [Jonathan Gootenberg and Omar Abudayyeh](https://www.abugootlab.org/) focuses on biological reasoning and generative modeling. I co-lead projects on developing multi-scale, multimodal co-diffusion architecture for spatial biology prediction. I am also involved in building a LLM AI-scientist in collaboration with Google and single-cell perturbation modeling towards building a Virtual Cell. I previously worked under the guidance of Professor [John H. Reif](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/research.html) and Professor [Marya Lieberman](https://chemistry.nd.edu/people/marya-lieberman/) on DNA nanotechnology, designing autocatalytic DNA nanomachines; and supervised by Professor [Yamil J. Colón](https://www.computationalnano.org/) on using deep learning to predict thermodynamics properties of ionic liquids.

# Research Summary
Life science remains a vast black box: its underlying logic concealed within the intricate interplay of molecular and cellular networks. My goal is to uncover the emergent behaviors that illuminate the fundamental principles of life.

I am particularly fascinated by the following questions:
* How do intricate signaling cascades within a cell interact to generate functions?
* How do individual cells coordinate to form multicellular organization and ultimately give rise to life?
* How can we design robust experimental platforms, AI models, and communication frameworks capable of unraveling the black box of complex biological networks?
* To understand life is to gain the language to write it: how can we edit, program, and write biology to deepen our understanding of life itself?
